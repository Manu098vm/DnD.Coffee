# DnD.Coffee

Welcome to DnD.Coffee, a Coffeelock optimizer for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition! This tool is designed to help you maximize the magical efficiency of the Coffeelock build, notorious for its game-breaking potential. Because if you're going to powerplay, you might as well do it right!

## What's a Coffeelock?

The Coffeelock is an absurdly optimized build combining Sorcerer and Warlock. It leverages short rests and spell slot conversions to generate an almost limitless pool of spell slots. Essentially, it's a way to keep casting spells without ever needing to sleep. Who needs sleep when you have magic (and caffeine), right?

## About This Project

This program calculates the optimal combinations of "universal" spell slots you can generate during a rest period, ensuring maximum efficiency. It’s your ultimate tool for managing magical resources while the rest of your party sleeps.

### Key Features:

- **Spell Slot Conversion**: Convert Warlock spell slots into Sorcery Points and then into universal spell slots. Flexibility is key—create the slots you need, when you need them.
- **Magical Item Integration**: Utilize items like the Rod of the Pact Keeper and Blood Well Vial to recover additional spell slots or Sorcery Points. More toys, more fun!
- **Warlock Slot Recovery Simulation**: Plan your short rests to refresh Warlock spell slots and keep the cycle going.

In short, it’s a tool for players who believe there’s no such thing as "overpowered"—only "efficient."

## Example

Ever wondered how to get the most out of an 8-hour rest? Imagine this:

- You currently have 1 level 3 Warlock spell slot.
- You currently have 6 Sorcery Points.
- You're wielding both the Pact Keeper Rod and the Blood Well Vial.
- You want to retain at least 5 Sorcery Points and 2 Warlock spell slot.

Input these into the program, and it will compute all the optimal combinations for you. Simple, efficient, and effective!

## A Quick Reminder...

IMHO the Coffeelock isn't inherently more powerful than other builds—just more versatile. However, while squeezing every ounce of optimization out of your character can be incredibly fun, it's worth remembering that **Dungeons & Dragons is a game meant to be enjoyed by everyone at the table, not just us min-maxers**.

To ensure everyone has a good time, always discuss your Coffeelock plans with your Dungeon Master and fellow players beforehand. By keeping your DM in the loop, you not only foster a more enjoyable game but also potentially avoid the surprise of facing a horde of beholders sent your way as a balancing act. After all, a happy party makes for the best adventures!
